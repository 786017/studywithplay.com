        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <h2>An interisting poem</h2>
        <h3><b>Animals:</b></h3>
        <img src="C:\Users\Satya Computer\Desktop\images.png">
       
        <p>I think I could turn and live with animals,<br> they are

            so placid and self-containâ€™d,<br>
            
            I stand and look at them long and long.<br><br>
             They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>
            
            They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>
            
            They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br>
            
            Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with<br>
            
            the mania of owning things,<br>
            
            Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that<br>
            
            lived thousands of years ago,<br>
            
            Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.<br>
            
            So they show their relations to me and I accept them,<br>
            
            They bring me tokens of myself, they evince<br>
            
            them plainly in their possession<br>
            
            I wonder where they get those tokens,<br>
            
            Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?<br><br>
